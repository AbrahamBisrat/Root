        <p>Poker is often misunderstood as a game of gambling. To the uninitiated, it is a chaotic swirl of luck and
            bravado. But to the student of the game, poker is a rigorous exercise in <strong>Expected Value
                (EV)</strong> and psychological warfare. It is perhaps the purest simulation of life: you must make
            high-stakes decisions with incomplete information.</p>

        <p>In chess, every piece is visible. In poker, the most critical variables are hidden behind the backs of cards
            and the stoic faces of opponents. This is the "Information Gap."</p>

        <h3>Interactive Scenario: The Decision Point</h3>
        <p>You are in a $1/$2 No-Limit Hold'em game. You hold <span class="card">A♠</span><span class="card">A♥</span>.
            The flop comes:</p>
        <div style="margin: 10px 0;">
            <span class="card">8♣</span> <span class="card">9♣</span> <span class="card">J♣</span>
        </div>
        <p>Your opponent, a tight-aggressive player, bets $50 into a $40 pot. You have $150 left. What is your move?</p>
        <button class="btn" onclick="makeDecision('call')">Call</button>
        <button class="btn btn-danger" onclick="makeDecision('fold')">Fold</button>
        <button class="btn" style="background:#2980b9" onclick="makeDecision('shove')">All-In</button>

        <h2>The Mathematics of Emotion</h2>
        <p>The scenario above highlights the tension between raw strength and board texture. While Pocket Aces are the
            best starting hand, on a board of 8-9-J of clubs, they are incredibly vulnerable. A single club, a ten, or a
            seven from your opponent could mean you are already drawing dead.</p>

        <p>Winning at poker requires "Result Independence." You can make the mathematically correct decision and still
            lose the hand. This is called <strong>Variance</strong>. The professional's goal is not to win every hand,
            but to make decisions that have a positive +EV over a sample size of thousands of hours.</p>
